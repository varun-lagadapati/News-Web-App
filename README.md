# VNews

This repository contains the files where I designed an application called VNews that uses the News API and made by Django version 3.1.3. I used Python 3.8 and PyCharm IDE 20.2.3 to design my app.

The app can be accessed through this link but doesn't seem to be working so it's still in progress: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
